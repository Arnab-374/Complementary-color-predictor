# Complementary-color-predictor
Using the Brain.js framework to build a complementary color predictor application on the web.

This is a very simple implementation of brain.js to predict complementary colors for the colors being input by a user.
One of the problems that I have faced in the past is deciding on the color scheme of a website. The UI of a website is extremely important. If the UI design is not upto the mark then your website will inevitably fail to attract attention. This application can be used to test out different complementary color schemes on the fly. Further changes will be made in future to actually show the values of the predicted colors.


I have created the entire dataset from scratch. It was tedious work, but it was worth it.
